# The-Red-Spring

The Red Spring is a game developed on a CodeNation course, it is a text based adventure game that is set in the 1900's with a lovecraftian theme of darkness and mystery.

We had roughly three days to plan, write and code the game and how it would work.
I myself worked on the coding structure, how it all flowed together and to make sure it worked from start to finish testing every instance I could.

It was a very enjoyable experience and i learned a lot. And i still have a lot to learn!
